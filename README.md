# Problems We Are Solving
Web3 Talent Hub addresses several critical challenges within the traditional freelance marketplace:

**1. High Fees and Slow Payments:** We eliminate excessive commission charges and expedite the payment process, reducing financial burdens on freelancers and clients.

**2. Limited Project Accessibility:** Unlike traditional platforms that focus on large projects, our platform welcomes a diverse range of project sizes, ensuring opportunities for all skill levels.

**3. Cumbersome Application Processes:** Our system simplifies the application process, allowing freelancers to easily apply without navigating through multiple external sites.

**4. Complex User Interfaces:** We streamline user interactions, providing a clean and intuitive interface that eliminates common annoyances like spam and fraudulent listings.

**5. Inefficient Selection Procedures:** Our platform reduces the time and complexity traditionally involved in hiring and project selection, minimizing service fees and maximizing efficiency.

#### How its work

- We created a smart contract that allows a client to mint opened projects or skilled person to mint their information of career.
- Unstoppable domain to login users or RainbowKit
- That data is minted on the Polygon testnet, and than its store on a decentralized manner using IPFS and Nft.Storage.
- Infomation is visiable to public, no extensive screening proces and Lengthy selection process, we are using the blockchain to pay only for gas fees on Polygon to process application and posted projects.
- We than select our field of intrest or the talent for our project - Using XMTP (Extensible Message Transport Protoco) a open protocol and network for secure and private web3 messaging to connect and get more information on the applicants or the company - by only using you chain address to communicate.
